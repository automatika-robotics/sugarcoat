# Sugarcoat

Build Event-Driven Modular Robotic Systems with an Intuitive Python API

  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; opacity: 0.8;">
    Sugarcoat is a <b>meta-framework</b> for developers who want to create robust, event-driven systems with multiple nodes that are easy to use and can be configured and launched with an intuitive Python API. It provides primitives for writing ROS2 nodes and events/actions which can start/stop/modify the nodes, in the spirit of true event-driven software. Sugarcoat is also a replacement for the ROS Launch API.
