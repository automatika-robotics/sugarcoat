# Recipes Launcher

**Recipes: One script to rule them all.**

The [`Launcher`](../apidocs/ros_sugar/ros_sugar.launch.launcher.md) is your entry point to the Sugarcoat ecosystem. It provides a clean, Pythonic API to configure, spawn, and orchestrate your ROS2 nodes without writing XML or complex launch files.

Under the hood, every Launcher spawns an internal **Monitor** node. This hidden "Brain" is responsible for tracking component health, listening for events, and executing the orchestration logic.

## Execution Architectures

The Launcher supports two execution modes, configured via the `multi_processing` flag.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Multi-Threaded
:sync: threaded

**Default for Debugging** (`multi_processing=False`)

All components run in the same process as the Launcher and Monitor.
* <span class="sd-text-success">**Pros:**</span> Fast startup, shared memory, easy debugging (breakpoints work everywhere).
* <span class="sd-text-danger">**Cons:**</span> The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can bottleneck performance if you have many heavy nodes.

:::

:::{tab-item} Multi-Process
:sync: process

**Production Mode** (`multi_processing=True`)

Each component runs in its own isolated process. The Monitor the still runs in the same process as the Launcher.

* <span class="sd-text-success">**Pros:**</span> True parallelism, crash isolation (one node crashing doesn't kill the system).
* <span class="sd-text-danger">**Cons:**</span> Higher startup overhead.

## Launcher Features

### 1. Package & Component Loading

You can add components from your current script or external packages.

```python
# Add from an external entry point (for multi-process separation)
launcher.add_pkg(
    package_name="my_robot_pkg",
    components=[vision_component] # Pass config/events here
    multiprocessing=True
)

```

### 2. Lifecycle Management

Sugarcoat components are Lifecycle nodes. The Launcher handles the transition state machine for you.

* `activate_all_components_on_start=True`: Automatically transitions all nodes to **Active** after spawning.

### 3. Global Fallbacks

Define "Catch-All" policies for the entire system.

```python
# If ANY component reports a crash, restart it.
launcher.on_component_fail(action_name="restart")

```

### 4. Events Orchestration

Pass your events/actions dictionary **once** to the `Launcher` and it will handle delegating the event monitoring to the concerned component.

## Complete Usage Example

```python
from ros_sugar.core import BaseComponent, Event, Action
from ros_sugar.actions import log, restart
from ros_sugar.io import Topic
from ros_sugar import Launcher

# 1. Define Components
# (Usually imported from your package)
driver = BaseComponent(component_name='lidar_driver')
planner = BaseComponent(component_name='path_planner')

# Set Fallback Policy
# If the driver crashes, try to restart it automatically
driver.on_component_fail(fallback=restart(component=driver))

# 2. Define Logic  for Events
battery = Topic(name="/battery", msg_type="Float32")
low_batt_evt = Event(battery.msg.data < 15.0)

log_action = log(msg="WARNING: Battery Low!")

# 3. Initialize Launcher
launcher = Launcher(
    config_file='config/robot_params.toml',     # Can optionally pass a configuration file
    activate_all_components_on_start=True,
    multi_processing=True # Use separate processes
)

# 4. Register Components
# You can attach specific events to specific groups of components
launcher.add_pkg(
    components=[driver, planner],
    ros_log_level="error"
    events_actions={low_batt_evt: log_action}
)

# 7. Launch!
# This blocks until Ctrl+C is pressed
launcher.bringup()

```

## The Monitor (Internal Engine)

:::{note}
The Monitor is configured automatically. You do not need to instantiate or manage it manually.
:::

The **Monitor** is a specialized, non-lifecycle ROS2 node that acts as the central management node.

**Responsibilities:**

1. **Custom Actions Execution:** Handles executing custom Actions defined in the recipe.
2. **Health Tracking:** Subscribes to the `/status` topic of every component.
3. **Orchestration:** Holds clients for every component's Lifecycle and Parameter services, allowing it to restart, reconfigure, or stop nodes on demand.

**Architecture:**

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Configuration
:sync: config

How the Launcher configures the Monitor with Events and Actions at startup.
